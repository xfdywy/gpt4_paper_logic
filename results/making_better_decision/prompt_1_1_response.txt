**Primary Objective:**
The primary objective of the study is to improve decision-making in continuous control tasks by directly planning in a learned environment model using a novel algorithm called Policy Optimization with Model Planning (POMP). This study specifically addresses the challenges of high-dimensional and continuous action spaces in model-based reinforcement learning (RL).

**Key Findings:**
1. **Novel Algorithm - POMP:** A new algorithm, Policy Optimization with Model Planning (POMP), is proposed. It integrates a Deep Differential Dynamic Programming (D3P) planner into the model-based RL framework.
2. **D3P Planner:** The D3P planner constructs a locally quadratic programming problem using a gradient-based optimization process to address the infinite number of candidate actions and the temporal dependency between actions at different timesteps.
3. **Theoretical Proofs:** The paper provides theoretical proof of the convergence rate for the D3P planner and analyzes the effect of the feedback term.
4. **Empirical Results:** Experiments demonstrate that POMP improves sample efficiency on continuous control tasks, outperforming state-of-the-art methods in terms of both sample efficiency and asymptotic performance.

**Significance:**
The study significantly advances model-based RL by effectively addressing the challenges posed by continuous action spaces. The proposed POMP algorithm demonstrates superior performance in continuous control benchmarks, suggesting its potential applicability in real-world physical systems where data collection is arduous and time-consuming.

**Methodology:**
- **D3P Planner:** The D3P planner optimizes the action sequence by leveraging first-order Taylor expansion of the optimal Bellman equation, constructing a quadratic objective function, and incorporating feedback from previous action updates.
- **POMP Algorithm:** The POMP algorithm integrates the D3P planner with a learned policy network to initialize action sequences and maintains conservative action updates to mitigate the effect of model errors.
- **Evaluation:** The algorithm was evaluated on MuJoCo continuous control tasks, and compared with state-of-the-art RL methods. Ablation studies were also conducted to verify the necessity and effectiveness of the D3P planner.

**Quantitative Results:**
- **Performance Metrics:** The performance of POMP was measured in terms of sample efficiency and asymptotic performance on six continuous control tasks.
- **Comparative Analysis:** POMP showed significant improvement over baseline methods, especially in tasks with high-dimensional action spaces (e.g., Ant and Humanoid).

**Experimental Models and Validation Techniques:**
- **Continuous Control Tasks:** The experiments were conducted on benchmark MuJoCo continuous control tasks.
- **Baseline Comparisons:** POMP was compared with multiple state-of-the-art methods including MAAC, MBPO, and others.
- **Ablation Studies:** Various ablation experiments were conducted to isolate the contributions of the D3P planner and other components of the POMP algorithm.

**Mechanisms and Pathways:**
- **Planning Mechanism:** The D3P planner uses a locally quadratic programming approach to optimize actions, considering both the current state and temporal dependencies.
- **Feedback Term:** The feedback term allows for the correction of action updates based on prior action changes, improving convergence and decision accuracy.

**Comparison with Existing Knowledge:**
- **Model-Based RL:** POMP advances model-based RL by providing a more efficient planning mechanism for continuous action spaces compared to traditional methods like MCTS, which are more suited to discrete action spaces.
- **Optimal Control Theory:** The D3P planner draws inspiration from Differential Dynamic Programming (DDP) in optimal control theory but adapts it for use with learned models in RL, addressing computational and generalization challenges.

**Future Implications or Applications:**
- **Real-World Applications:** The POMP algorithm's ability to improve sample efficiency makes it suitable for applications in real-world physical systems where data collection is limited.
- **Further Research:** Future work could focus on incorporating model uncertainty to better balance exploration and exploitation, and extending the algorithm to more complex and dynamic environments.
