The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 in late 2019 catalyzed a global health crisis, resulting in the COVID-19 pandemic. As the virus spread rapidly, it became evident that developing new antiviral treatments or vaccines would take considerable time, typically 12-18 months for vaccines and over a decade for new antiviral drugs. Given this delay, the scientific community turned to drug repurposing as a promising strategy to identify existing drugs that could be used to treat COVID-19 more quickly. This approach leverages the safety and pharmacological profiles of existing drugs, potentially accelerating their deployment for new therapeutic purposes.

To identify potential antiviral drugs against SARS-CoV-2, researchers conducted a high-throughput screening of approximately 12,000 clinical-stage or FDA-approved small molecules. This large-scale screening aimed to find compounds that could inhibit the replication of the virus. The study utilized Vero E6 cells, known for their high permissibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection, and measured viral-induced cytopathogenic effects (CPE) to assess the antiviral activity of the compounds. The assay was optimized for robustness and reproducibility, ensuring reliable identification of antiviral candidates.

From this extensive screening, 100 molecules were found to inhibit viral replication, with 21 drugs demonstrating clear dose-response relationships. Of particular interest were 13 drugs that exhibited effective concentrations within probable therapeutic doses for patients. Among these, the PIKfyve kinase inhibitor apilimod and several cysteine protease inhibitors (MDL-28170, Z LVG CHN2, VBY-825, and ONO 5334) were highlighted. Notably, MDL-28170, ONO 5334, and apilimod demonstrated the ability to antagonize viral replication in human pneumocyte-like cells derived from H9 human embryonic stem cell lines. Apilimod also showed antiviral efficacy in a primary human lung explant model, underscoring its potential as a therapeutic candidate.

The study further explored the mechanisms of action of these drugs. For example, apilimod, a PIKfyve kinase inhibitor, was found to inhibit viral entry, consistent with its role in maintaining endomembrane homeostasis. The cysteine protease inhibitors likely acted by inhibiting host proteases necessary for the proteolytic processing of viral proteins. Importantly, these drugs have well-documented safety profiles from previous clinical trials, which could expedite their preclinical and clinical evaluation for treating COVID-19.

Overall, the findings from this large-scale drug repurposing screen offer significant promise for rapidly identifying effective treatments for COVID-19. The identification of drugs with existing pharmacological and safety data enables a faster transition into clinical testing, potentially providing new therapeutic options to combat the ongoing pandemic and mitigate future outbreaks.
