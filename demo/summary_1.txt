### Objective Facts
1. The study aimed to find existing drugs that could be repurposed to treat COVID-19.
2. A large library of around 12,000 approved or clinically tested drugs was used, which have known pharmacological and human safety profiles.
3. A total of 100 drugs were discovered to be able to stop the virus from replicating in cells.
4. Thirteen drugs exhibited a cellular half-maximal effective concentration (EC50) value of less than 500 nM, indicating they were effective at doses likely safe for patients.
5. ONO 5334, MDL 28170, and apilimod showed antiviral activity in human induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived pneumocyte-like cells by reducing the number of infected cells by 72%, 65%, and 85%, respectively.
6. Apilimod was also effective in an ex vivo lung culture system, reducing viral titre with plaque assay.
7. Time-of-addition experiments identified which stage of the viral life cycle the compounds target.
8. The five most potent compounds—apilimod, VBY-825, ONO 5334, Z LVG CHN2, and MDL 28170—inhibit viral entry.
9. The protease inhibitors VBY-825, ONO 5334, Z LVG CHN2, and MDL 28170 do not inhibit SARS-CoV-2's 3C-like or papain-like proteases, suggesting they act on host proteases.
10. Z LVG CHN2 likely targets endosomal proteases, while MDL 28170, ONO 5334, and VBY-825 inhibit various cathepsins necessary for viral protein processing.

### Logical Inferences
1. **Drug Selection Basis**: The use of approved or clinically tested drugs with known pharmacological and safety profiles allows for quicker preclinical and clinical evaluation.
2. **Effectiveness Evaluation**: Through cellular assays, 100 drugs were identified to inhibit viral replication, with 13 drugs being effective at concentrations below 500 nM, suggesting potential safety and efficacy for patients.
3. **Specific Drug Efficacy**: ONO 5334, MDL 28170, and apilimod demonstrated significant antiviral effects in iPSC-derived pneumocyte-like cells, with apilimod also proving effective in ex vivo lung culture systems.
4. **Mechanism of Action**: Time-of-addition experiments revealed that the five most potent compounds primarily inhibit viral entry. Although they are protease inhibitors, they do not target the viral 3C-like or papain-like proteases, indicating they act on host proteases instead.
5. **Role of Host Proteases**: Detailed analysis shows that Z LVG CHN2 likely targets endosomal proteases, while MDL 28170, ONO 5334, and VBY-825 inhibit various cathepsins, which are essential for viral protein processing.
