The study presents a novel approach to improve decision-making in continuous control tasks by directly incorporating a learned environment model into the planning process. This method addresses two main challenges: the infinite number of candidate actions and the temporal dependency between actions at different timesteps. The researchers developed the Policy Optimization with Model Planning (POMP) algorithm, which integrates a Deep Differential Dynamic Programming (D3P) planner into the model-based reinforcement learning (RL) framework.

The D3P planner leverages first-order Taylor expansion to construct a locally quadratic programming problem, enabling efficient optimization in continuous action spaces. This planner updates the action of the current step by considering the latest actions of previous timesteps, thus addressing the temporal dependency challenge. The theoretical analysis proved the convergence rate of the D3P planner and highlighted the importance of the feedback term in improving the convergence.

In practice, the POMP algorithm initializes the action sequence using a policy network and maintains conservative action updates during planning to mitigate the limitations of the learned model's generalization. This approach ensures that the model's predictions remain accurate, thereby improving the overall decision-making process.

Experiments conducted on benchmark continuous control tasks in the MuJoCo simulator demonstrated that POMP consistently enhances sample efficiency and performance compared to state-of-the-art model-free and model-based RL methods. Notably, POMP showed significant improvements in tasks with high-dimensional action spaces, such as Ant and Humanoid.

Ablation studies confirmed the necessity of planning for better decision-making in continuous control. The results showed that increasing the update times of the policy did not improve performance, whereas using the D3P planner led to consistent improvements. Moreover, the D3P planner outperformed other planners, such as SGD-like, CEM, and random-shooting planners, highlighting its efficiency and effectiveness.

The study also examined the impact of model quality on decision-making. It was found that even models trained on early-stage data could effectively improve the policy's performance when used with the D3P planner. Additionally, the D3P planner efficiently optimized the trajectory quality, with performance improvements plateauing after a certain number of iterations.

The integration of the policy network into the POMP framework was found to be crucial. Initializing the trajectory with the policy network and using a conservative term during evaluation significantly enhanced the planner's performance. Randomly initialized trajectories did not yield meaningful actions, underscoring the importance of the policy network in the planning process.

In conclusion, the POMP algorithm, with its D3P planner, offers a robust solution for continuous control tasks by efficiently leveraging a learned environment model for planning. The study's findings suggest that integrating model planning into RL frameworks can lead to substantial improvements in decision-making and sample efficiency. Future work could explore incorporating model uncertainty into the planning process to further enhance the trade-off between exploration and exploitation.
