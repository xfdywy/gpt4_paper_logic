The study explores the expressive power of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) beyond the Weisfeiler-Lehman (WL) test, introducing a new class of expressivity metrics based on graph biconnectivity. Biconnectivity, which includes properties like cut vertices and cut edges, is crucial for understanding graph structures as it breaks down graphs into smaller, interconnected components. Despite the simplicity and linear computational cost of calculating biconnectivity through classic algorithms, the study finds that most existing GNN architectures struggle to leverage these metrics effectively.

In this research, a comprehensive analysis of popular GNN architectures is conducted, revealing that none of them can systematically solve biconnectivity problems. The only exception is the Equivariant Subgraph Aggregation Network (ESAN), which uses the DSS-WL algorithm with node marking policy. This algorithm can identify cut vertices and cut edges, providing a robust theoretical foundation for its expressiveness. However, the DSS-WL framework is computationally expensive and complex, prompting the need for a more efficient solution.

To address these challenges, the study introduces the Generalized Distance Weisfeiler-Lehman (GD-WL) framework, which incorporates distance metrics into the WL aggregation process. Two specific distance metrics are highlighted: Shortest Path Distance (SPD) for edge-biconnectivity and Resistance Distance (RD) for vertex-biconnectivity. The GD-WL framework is proven to be fully expressive for all biconnectivity problems, significantly enhancing the theoretical understanding and practical capabilities of GNNs.

The practical implementation of GD-WL can be achieved through a Transformer-like architecture named Graphormer-GD. This architecture injects distance information into Multi-head Attention, maintaining expressiveness while ensuring full parallelizability. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that Graphormer-GD consistently outperforms prior GNN architectures on both synthetic tasks (like cut vertex and cut edge detection) and real-world datasets (e.g., the ZINC benchmark for molecular graphs).

In summary, this study provides a novel perspective on GNN expressiveness through biconnectivity, introducing the efficient and powerful GD-WL framework. This framework holds promise for various applications, particularly those requiring detailed structural graph analysis, and sets the stage for future research into more expressive and computationally efficient GNN architectures.
