 A Layered Organic Cathode for High-Energy, Fast-Charging, and Long-Lasting Li-Ion Batteries
ABSTRACT: Eliminating the use of critical metals in cathode materials
can accelerate global adoption of rechargeable lithium-ion batteries.
Organic cathode materials, derived entirely from earth-abundant
elements, are in principle ideal alternatives but have not yet challenged
inorganic cathodes due to poor conductivity, low practical storage
capacity, or poor cyclability. Here, we describe a layered organic
electrode material whose high electrical conductivity, high storage
capacity, and complete insolubility enable reversible intercalation of Li+
ions, allowing it to compete at the electrode level, in all relevant metrics,
with inorganic-based lithium-ion battery cathodes. Our optimized
cathode stores 306 mAh g−1
cathode, delivers an energy density of 765
Wh kg−1
cathode, higher than most cobalt-based cathodes, and can charge−
discharge in as little as 6 min. These results demonstrate the operational
competitiveness of sustainable organic electrode materials in practical batteriLithium-ion batteries (LIBs) are dominant energy storage
solutions for electrifying the transportation sector and are
becoming increasingly important for decarbonizing the grid.
Traditional cathodes for LIBs are made from inorganic oxides,
especially those of Co, Ni, and Mn (e.g., LiCoO2 (LCO) and
LiNi1−x−yMnxCoyO2 (NMC)).1 Of these, cobalt poses severe
limitations due to its scarcity and high social cost (e.g., child
labor).2,3 Complete removal of cobalt has proven difficult, as
oxide cathodes that are Co-free suffer from poor cyclability or
capacity.4,5 Indeed, today, electric vehicles overwhelmingly use
Co-based batteries. However, expansion of the global EV fleet
is essentially impossible without the development of cobalt-free
technologies.6 This has led to significant efforts in developing
LIBs using more abundant and cost-effective lithium iron
phosphate (LFP) as a cathode,7,8 despite LFP’s known inferior
energy density relative to oxide-based cathodes and phosphate’s critical role in agriculture notwithstanding.9−11 Clearly,
LIBs would benefit from the development of sustainable
cathode technologies based on inexpensive, abundant
precursors that can be sourced and scaled globally through
more environmentally benign processRedox-active organic materials, derived entirely from earthabundant elements, offer just such an opportunity.12,13 They
benefit from excellent compositional diversity and structural
tunability while offering requisite synthetic control for targeted
designs as cathode materials for not only LIBs but also other
battery systems such as Na-ion or Zn-ion batteries. Although
the merits of replacing inorganic cathodes with organic
electrode materials (OEMs) have long been appreciated in
the literature,14−16 material candidates in this class that deliver
comprehensive performance along all metrics relevant for
practical LIBs have remained elusive. From a design
perspective, small organic molecules offer high specific
capacities by virtue of a dense arrangement of redox sites
and their low molar masses relative to those of redox-active
polymers or framework materials. However, discrete molecules
typically have low bulk conductivity and often dissolve in
battery electrolytes, which lead to poor utilization of redox
sites, low charge−discharge rates, and poor cycling stability.17
These issues are routinely managed by adding electrically
conducting and/or stabilizing polymeric additives typically
exceeding 50 wt %, which greatly reduce the effective capacity,
rendering the electrodes impractical.18−25 Alternative strategies
to polymerize redox-active OEM candidates or to immobilize
them into host frameworks often require compromise in at
least one of the critical practical metrics.15,16 As such, there
continues to be a strong interest in designing intrinsically
insoluble and electrically conducting OEMs that exhibit high
specific capacity at appropriate cathodic voltages (>2.0 V) for
LIBs (Figure 1A). To our knowledge, OEMs for LIBs that
fulfill all these criteria so as to rival inorganic cathodes are not
known.1Here, we demonstrate that bis-tetraaminobenzoquinone
(TAQ), a fused conjugated molecule with a layered solidstate structure, functions as a fast-charging, high-energy, and
long-lasting OEM for LIB cathodes. As reported recently,26
TAQ is characterized by a dense arrangement of redox-active
carbonyl (C�O) and imine (C�N) groups on a conjugated
backbone. Two 2e− redox couples give TAQ a high theoretical
specific capacity of 356 mAh g−1
. Strong intermolecular
hydrogen bonding and donor−acceptor (D-A) π−π interactions in TAQ render it insoluble in common battery
electrolytes and impart extended electronic delocalization
that leads to high bulk electrical conductivity. These features
allow optimized electrodes that comprise at least 90 wt % of
TAQ to reversibly store charge and cycle safely for over 2000
cycles, strongly contrasting with the issues of electrode
dissolution chronically experienced in known OEMs (Figure
1A). The two-dimensional (2D) layered arrangement of TAQ
molecules enables facile insertion/extraction of Li+ between
the layers and delivers excellent rate capabilities even at full
charging in as little as 3 min. Optimized electrodes deliver
excellent performance even at high areal mass loadings up to
16 mg cm−2 with an areal capacity up to 3.52 mAh cm−2
, which
is on par with commercial lithium-ion batteries,27 comprehensively demonstrating the viability of TAQ in practical LRESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Crystal Structure, Electronic Structure, and Electrical
Conductivity of TAQ. TAQ is obtained in gram quantities by
Michael condensation of tetraamino-p-benzoquinone (see
Supporting Information, Materials and Methods) as highly
crystalline microrods, whose identity was verified by wideangle X-ray scattering (WAXS), scanning electron microscopy
(SEM), and cryogenic electron microscopy (Cryo-EM)
(Figure S1A−C). TAQ exhibits significant keto−enol
tautomerization (Figure 1B) through the conjugation of
carbonyl and amino groups within the two diaminobenzoquinone moieties that are connected by a dihydropyrazine core
(Table S1), leading to both quinone and imine forms. The
contribution of the imine tautomer is evidenced by the C�N
signal at 140.8 ppm in its 13C solid-state NMR (ssNMR)
spectrum (Figures 1C, S2) and from the partial double bond
character of the two C−NH2 bonds evidenced in the single
crystal structure (Figure S1D). The dihydropyrazine linkage is
crucial for enabling significant electronic delocalization
between the two neighboring diaminobenzoquinone moieties.
This distinguishes it from the related molecule tetraaminophenazine-1,4,6,9-tetrone (Figure S3),28 whose calculated
HOMO−LUMO gap, 2.212 eV, is nearly 1 eV higher than
that of TAQ, 1.242 eV (Figure 1B, Table SPlanar TAQ molecules are surrounded by six neighbors and
closely pack into two-dimensional layers through pervasive
intermolecular hydrogen bonding between carbonyl and
amine/imine functional groups (Figure 1D). These layers
stack through strong donor−acceptor π−π interactions with a
short interlayer distance of 3.14 Å (Figure 1E). Highresolution cryo-EM images of TAQ (Figures 1F,G, S4−S6)
and the corresponding fast Fourier transform (FFT) further
confirmed its dense molecular packing and the out-of-plane
close stacking of 2D layers. Owing to its compact solid-state
packing, TAQ exhibits very low solubility in common organic
solvents and battery electrolytes (Figure S1E). Notably,
heating TAQ in deuterated N,N-dimethylformamide at 120
°C overnight leads to little dissolution, as verified by the
absence of TAQ signals in the 1
H and 13C spectra of the
supernatant (Figure 1H). The unusually low solubility of TAQ,
even at an elevated temperature, stands in stark contrast to
other OEMs reported for LIBs (Figure S7) and is key for a
long cycling lifetiOwing to a combination of intramolecular extended
conjugation, intermolecular hydrogen bonding, and interlayer
π−π stacking, TAQ also exhibits broadband electronic
absorption from 200 to nearly 1600 nm (Figure 1G),
indicating significant electronic delocalization. This again
contrasts with any other molecular OEMs, and some
prototypical charge-transfer complexes,29 conjugated polymers,30 and organic radical polymers,31 which show absorption
only below 800 nm (Figures 1I, S8) and thus have poor
electronic delocalization. TAQ also exhibits an optical gap of
∼0.8 eV, which is comparable with doped poly(pyrrole).32 The
electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectrum of TAQ
(Figure S9A) revealed the presence of delocalized organic
spins, as verified by the Dysonian line shape of the signal and
the corresponding line shape asymmetry indicator (i.e., the
ratio of the positive to the negative part of the EPR signal),
1.32, which is similar to some single-walled carbon nanotubes.33 The organic spins, which likely originate from the
partial oxidation of the dihydropyrazine moiety, have a Curie
spin density of 0.032 per TAQ molecule, as indicated by the
variable temperature direct current susceptibility measurement
of TAQ (Figure S9B), and delocalize through extended
conjugation. Because of these features, TAQ exhibits semiconducting behavior with a charge transport activation energy
of 319 meV and room-temperature electrical conductivity of
up to 2.1 × 10−4 S cm−1 (Figure S9C,D). This is substantially
higher than most molecular OEMs, which are either poor
conductors or insulators (Figure S10, Table S3), and is also
higher than or comparable with charge-transfer complexes,
organosulfur compounds, conjugated polymers, and organic
radical polymers.29−31 Remarkably, the electrical conductivity
of TAQ is on par with that of LCO and state-of-the-art
NMC,34,35 and is approximately 5 orders of magnitude higher
than that of LFP.36 These favorable properties of TAQ allow
fabrication of battery electrodes with little to no additives. In
contrast, most, if not all, OEMs routinely need at least 40 wt %
additives (Figures 1J, S9E)Neat TAQ Cathodes. Due to its high conductivity and
poor solubility, neat TAQ (without conductive and binder
additives) can be directly used as a cathode (see Supporting
Information, Methods) in Li-ion half cells using lithium anodes
and commercial LP30 electrolyte (1.0 M LiPF6 in 1:1 ethylene
carbonate (EC)/dimethyl carbonate (DMC)). Galvanostatic
charge−discharge (GCD) voltage profiles (Figure 2A)
recorded at 25 mA g−1 (0.125 C) between 1.6 and 3.2 V (all
potentials are referenced to the Li+
/Li couple unless otherwise
noted) exhibit initial discharge and charge capacities of 297
mAh g−1 and 258 mAh g−1 based on the cathode mass,
respectively. The initial Coulombic efficiency (ICE) is 87%, in
line with the 80%−86% ICEs observed in commercial NMC
cathodes.37 dQ/dV curves (Figure S11A) exhibit four plateaus
centered around 2.3, 2.7, 2.8, and 3.0 V during charging, where
the middle two plateaus are hardly distinguishable in the
voltage profile (Figure 2A). In comparison, two distinct
plateaus between 2.9 V−2.5 and 2.3 V−2.0 V were observed
during discharge, which are centered at 2.2 and 2.6 V,
respectively. Both of these discharge plateaus store nearly equal
amounts of charge, ∼130 mAh g−1
, resulting in a nominal
discharge potential of 2.5 V. Replacing lithium anodes with
prelithiated graphite anodes (GrLi, see Supporting Information, Methods and Figure S11B) gives similar voltage profiles
and capacity. Increasing the areal mass loading of neat TAQ to
10 mg cm−2
, a loading rarely reached with organic cathodes
even when these are mixed with 50 wt % of carbon, maintained
a capacity as high as 181 mAh g−1 (i.e., 1.8 mAh cm−2
),
compared to 210 mAh g−1 at a loading of 2.5 mg cm−2 (Figure
2A). Faster charging rates of 0.4 C and 2.5 C delivered
discharge capacities of 207 and 106 mAh g−1 (Figure 2B),
respectively. Furthermore, 10 and 6 min constant-current
constant-voltage (CCCV) charging delivered discharge
capacities of 125 and 105 mAh g−1
, respectively (Figure 2C).
Diffusion coefficients of Li+ in neat TAQ electrodes obtained
using galvanostatic intermittent titration techniques (GITT)
revealed values of ∼10−10 cm2 s
−1 throughout the discharging/
charging processes (Figure S11C,D). These coefficients are
similar to those of state-of-the-art optimized inorganic
cathodes35 and highlight facile Li+ diffusion within TAQ
crystals and in bulk neatCycling studies at low charge−discharge rates are generally
employed to evaluate the ability of OEMs to withstand
dissolution into the electrolyte under operating conditions.
Neat TAQ electrodes are stable to at least 50 cycles at 0.2
CCCV/0.125 C, at 100% depth of discharge (DOD), with a
capacity retention of 75% and an average CE greater than 98%
(Figures 2D, S11E). No electrode dissolution was observed
after cycling, but TAQ rods did show fracturing into flakes, as
verified by ex-situ SEM images (Figure S12). Cycling at higher
rates of 1 CCCV/1 C and 4 CCCV/0.5 C maintains near
100% CE with a capacity retention of 88% over 100 cycles and
80% over 200 cycles (Figure 2E). This cycling performance of
neat OEM electrodes is unprecedented and serves as a
testament to the facile ion diffusion and charge transport
ability of TAQ, as well as its virtual insolubility in common
battery electrolyEmploying neat TAQ as the cathode also enabled direct
spectroscopic analysis of the redox processes without
interference from the electrode additives. An ex-situ 13C
ssNMR spectrum of TAQ discharged to 2.0 V (Figure 2F)
revealed the disappearance of both C�N (140.8 ppm) and
C�O (169.2 ppm) signals, indicating that both functional
groups are reduced during discharge despite the overall
spectrum broadening. An EPR spectrum of discharged TAQ
(Figure S13A) revealed significantly increased radical content,
corresponding to approximately 0.85 free radical per TAQ,
close to the theoretical value of 1 radical per TAQ for a sample
with a discharge capacity of 268.3 mAh g−1 (∼75% of the
theoretical capacity). A fit of the EPR spectrum attributed the
signal to a TAQ biradical (Figure S13B). Ex-situ FTIR spectra
of TAQ measured at different potentials (Figure 2G) exhibit a
gradual decrease and recovery of the C�O and C�N
stretching bands at 1618 and 1531 cm−1
, respectively,
reflecting the discharge and recharge processes. Interestingly,
the O−H (3464 cm−1
) stretching band, imine N−H (3346
cm−1
) stretching band, and the O−H scissoring band coupled
to dihydropyrazine ring modes (1460 cm−1
), all of which stem
from the imine tautomer (Figure S14), almost completely
disappear when TAQ is discharged to the first plateau at ∼2.5
V. Given that the quinone form has a lower LUMO energy
(Figure 1B), which in principle translates to a higher reduction
potential relative to the imine form, is more likely to accept
electrons initially during discharge, which simultaneously shifts
the tautomerization equilibrium from imine to quinone. This is
supported by ex-situ XPS data of TAQ discharged to 2.5 V
(Figure S15), which confirm the disappearance of imine N and
C−OH from the imine tautomer of TAQ, and the reduction of
quinoid (C�O) to benzenoid (C−O−). TAQ discharged to
2.5 V is proposed to contain diradicals, which is supported by
its DRUV−vis spectrum, revealing a significant polaronic band
centered around 1200 nm (Figure 2H). Subsequent twoelectron reduction gives the fully reduced TAQ, corresponding
to the second plateau centered around 2.2 V. Ex-situ DRUV−
vis spectra of TAQ discharged to both 2.5 and 2.0 V (Figure
S 13C) also reveal less intramolecular electronic delocalization
relative to charged TAQ due to the lack of tautomerization
(Figure 2I), as verified by the blue-shifted absorption at 2.67
eV (2.0 V) and 2.56 eV (2.5 V) relative to 2.41 eV for charged
TAQ. Surprisingly, discharge promotes intermolecular electronic delocalization, indicated by the significantly enhanced
polaronic absorption in the near-IR (Figure 2H). The result is
that the electrical conductivity of TAQ discharged to 2.0 V
remains essentially unchanged compared to that of its charged
state (Figure S13D). The redox behavior of TAQ upon
prolonged cycling does not affect its molecular structure: FTIR
spectra and XPS analysis of electrodes cycled for over 100
cycles at a low rate are nearly indistinguishable from those of
pristine electrodes (Figures S16, S17). Overall, these features
establish the redox cycling of TAQ as a two-step, four-electron
process, corresponding to a high theoretical capacity of 356
mAh gOptimized TAQ cathodes. Mixing TAQ with as little as
10 wt % additives further enhances its performance to reach
near theoretical capacity. Specifically, carboxymethyl cellulose
(CMC) and/or styrene butadiene rubber (SBR) allow the
formulation of TAQ slurries in water (see Supporting
Information, Methods), more environmentally friendly than
N-methylpyrrolidone,38 and improve performance without
sacrificing electrode-level metrCompared to neat TAQ electrodes, TAQ/CMC composite
electrodes delivered greater reversible capacity of 286 mAh
g−1
TAQ (Li anode) or 299 mAh g−1
TAQ (GrLi anode) at 25 mA
g−1 in LP30, enhanced ICE of 92−94% (Figures 3A, S18A,B),
significantly improved rate capability, and greater cycling
stability (Figure S18C−F). A proof-of-concept TAQ/CMC||
GrLi full cell with a nearly balanced negative/positive electrode
capacity ratio (N/P) of 1.1 exhibited a cathode capacity of 180
mAh g−1 (Figure S1Despite their superior performance relative to neat TAQ,
TAQ/CMC electrodes suffered from poor adhesion to the
current collectors, which prompted us to use increments of the
SBR additive for optimized electrode formulations. Although
increasing SBR content decreases the overall electrode capacity
(Figure 3A), the CMC/SBR combination, common in
commercial graphite anodes, substantially enhances the
mechanical integrity and adhesion of TAQ to the stainless
steel current collector (Figure S20). A CMC:SBR ratio of 4:1
provided a good balance of the capacity and mechanical
properties, leading to optimized electrodes with uniform and
robust coatings (Figure 3A insets) and a reversible capacity of
275 mAh g−1
TAQ. The CMC/SBR composite further increases
the stability of already insoluble TAQ, such that TAQ/CMC/
SBR electrodes show very limited dissolution in LP30 even at
100 °C after 24 h (Figure S2Further increase in capacity is possible by addition of 5%
vinylene carbonate (VC) to the LP30 electrolyte (LP30VC), a
common strategy in commercial devices.39 This led to an initial
discharge capacity of 356 mAh g−1
TAQ, equal to TAQ’s
theoretical capacity, and an improved reversible capacity of 324
mAh g−1
TAQ (Figure 3B). Rate capability studies in LP30VC
revealed a cathode capacity of 192 mAh g−1 at 10 CCCV and
166 mAh g−1 at 20 CCCV (Figure 3C), which correspond to
total charging times of 6 and 3 min, with a capacity retention of
80% and 70%, respectively, relative to 240 mAh g−1 at 0.5
CCCV (i.e., a total charging time of 2 h). Stable fast-switching
between cathode capacities of 239 mAh g−1 at 0.5 C and 90
mAh g−1 at 30 C (charging time of 2 min) further highlights
the high power capability of TAQ (Figure 3C inset). Replacing
LP30VC with LP40VC (1.0 M LiPF6 in 1:1 EC/diethyl
carbonate (DEC) with 5% VC) enhanced the performance in
cells with GrLi anodes (Figure SCompared with carbonate electrolytes, ether-based electrolytes such as 1.0 M lithium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide
in 1:1 1,3-dioxolane/dimethoxyethane (LiTFSI/DOL/DME)
are known to deliver better CE with lithium anodes.40,41 TAQ
composite electrodes delivered reversible capacities of up to
340 mAh g−1
TAQ (Figure 3B) with enhanced ICE of 95−100%
(Figure S23) based on five cells, and stable cycling at 25 mA
g−1 and 100% DOD in LiTFSI/DOL/DME, exhibiting a
cathode capacity of 254 mAh g−1 after 100 cycles (i.e., 92%
retention after more than three months of continuous cycling;
Figure 3D). Cycling studies at higher current densities ranging
from 40 mA g−1 (0.2 C) to 2000 mA g−1 (10 C) revealed a
limited decrease of the average cathode capacity over 600-h
cycling from 256 to 157 mAh g−1 (Figure 3E, Table S4),
suggesting both outstanding power performance and cycling
stability. Specifically, cycling studies at 0.4 A g−1 (2C) and 1 A
g−1 (5C) revealed a cathode capacity of 213 mAh g−1 after
1000 cycles and 159 mAh g−1 after 2000 cycles (Figure 3F),
corresponding to capacity retention of 88% and 70%,
respectively. More importantly, TAQ’s molecular structure
remains unchanged upon prolonged cycling (Figure S24).
GITT studies revealed slightly higher diffusion coefficients of
Li+ in LiTFSI/DOL/DME (∼10−9 cm2 s
−1
) relative to that of
LP30 (∼10−10 cm2 s
−1
) (Figure S25). Significantly lower
charge transfer resistances (Rct), ranging from 20 to 40 Ω
during the whole charge/discharge process, were observed in
LiTFSI/DOL/DME relative to LP30 (Figure 3G, S26, S27).
Ion diffusion resistances (Rdiffusion) remained below 40 Ω from
2.1 to 3.2 V in LiTFSI/DOL/DME, superior to the step-like
increase of Rdiffusion at a higher degree of discharge in LP30.
Nevertheless, the Rct and Rdiffusion values observed in both LP30
and LiTFSI/DOL/DME are among the lowest values observed
for any cathode materials at similar active content levels, and
lower even than organic cathodes mixed with significant
amounts of conducting additives.42 Overall, these metrics are
indicative of rapid and reversible Li ion intercalation in TAQ,
which enable its function as a cathode against metallic Li and
prelithiated graphite anoStructural and Morphological Evolution. TAQ’s
crystallinity and extreme insolubility enabled structural studies
of Li+ intercalation and deintercalation through a combination
of in-operando powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD; Figure S28)
and ex-situ electron microscopy. Electrodes of TAQ were
prepared as free-standing films, suitable for in-operando
experiments, with 30 wt % carbon black and 10 wt %
polytetrafluoroethylene binder (see Supporting Information,
Methods). Cycling was performed at a practically relevant
current density of 200 mA g−1
. Tellingly, the interlayer
distance, d102, which appears at 3.14 Å in pristine TAQ,
increases to 3.32 Å upon discharging through the first cycle,
where TAQ undergoes Li+ intercalation and a phase transition
to Li2TAQ (Figure 4A). Upon further discharging and
formation of Li4TAQ, the interlayer distance fluctuates
between 3.27 and 3.38 Å (Figures 4B, S29), as expected for
the accommodation of both four Li+ ions and a greater
electrostatic repulsion between tetranionic TAQ4− molecules.
The interlayer distance fluctuates once again within the same
range upon charging, when Li4TAQ first transforms to
Li2TAQ, but the PXRD data do not provide sufficient
resolution to describe structural details of this transformation
at this stage (see related discussion in Supporting Information). Interestingly, the structural progression between the
limiting compositions, Li2TAQ and recharged TAQ, is smooth,
as verified by the continuous shifting of interlayer distance
between 3.32 and 3.19 Å. This is indicative of a Li+
intercalation/deintercalation mechanism that occurs in a
single-phase solid solution LixTAQ (x = 0−2) during steady
state cycling (Figure 4B).43 The coherent phase transformations through the formation of extended solid solutions
during charge−discharge, likely enabled by the flexible layered
structure and the strong in-plane molecular packing of TAQ,
account for the good rate capability of TAQ cathodes. A
similar smooth transition between charged and discharged
phases is also key for enabling the high-rate performance of
nanosized olivine phosphate cathodes.44 Notably, fully recharged TAQ has slightly expanded lattice dimensions (575.8
Å3
; see cryo-EM analysis in Supporting Information and Figure
S30) relative to pristine TAQ (540.3 Å3
), suggesting that initial
lithiation of TAQ and delithiation of Li4TAQ induce a slight
rearrangement of individual TAQ/TAQ4− molecules, which
subsequently support continuous cycling without further
structural changes. Importantly, differences in the interlayer
spacing between Li4TAQ and recharged TAQ suggest a
maximal volume change of 6.0% under a high lithiation
capacity of 300 mAh g−1
TAQ, an important consideration for
potential practicalBenchmarking TAQ in Practically Relevant Metrics
against Other Cathode Material Classes. One of the
major challenges for OEMs is the difficulty of achieving high
areal mass loadings.45 OEMs have relatively low densities and
thus require fabrication into thicker electrodes in order to
achieve mass loadings that are comparable to those of
inorganic cathodes. However, thicker electrodes made from
intrinsically insulating common OEMs compound the problem
of high ohmic resistances at practical-level mass loadings. As
exposed above, TAQ is electrically conductive and virtually
insoluble, but it also has high crystallographic density (for an
OEM) of 1.9 g cm−3
, which leads to a compaction density of
∼1.1 g cm−3 for TAQ cathodes and enables high mass loadings
and areal capacities. Indeed, TAQ/CMC/SBR||Li cells with
cathode mass loadings up to 15 mg cm−2 deliver cathode
capacities of ∼230 mAh g−1 in both LP40VC and LiTFSI/
DOL/DME (Figures 5A, S31A), corresponding to practically
competitive areal capacities up to 3.52 mAh cm−2
. Cycling
electrodes with a mass loading of 12 mg cm−2 at a current
density of 0.1 A g−1 (0.5C) and 100% DOD delivered a
cathode capacity of 166 mAh g−1 after 150 cycles, with 87%
capacity retention (Figure 5B). Moreover, increasing the rate
from 25 to 200 mA g−1 delivered a consistent average
discharge potential of 2.5 V and a 75% capacity retention
(Figures 5B, S31B). Most relevantly, TAQ/CMC/SBR||GrLi
full cells using LP40VC with TAQ mass loadings as high as 16
mg cm−2 and N/P ratios as low as 1.1 reached areal cathode
capacities of 3.25 mAh cm−2 at 25 mA g−1 (Figures 5A,
S31C,D), on par with the highest areal capacities reported
previously for OEMs employing advanced electrode engineering.1The electrode-level gravimetric specific capacities and
energies of TAQ are compared with state-of-the-art inorganic
and organic cathode materials in Figure 5C,D (material details
and source data in Figure S32 and Tables S5 and S6). As
discussed briefly earlier, typical OEMs are insulating and
require large amounts (30−70 wt %) of conducting additives
and binders, significantly above the commercial standard of 5−
10 wt %. Thus, even though many OEMs exhibit high materiallevel metrics, their more practically relevant electrode-level
metrics are modest. Here, because TAQ cells function with 90
wt % active material loading, TAQ-based cathodes store up to
306 mAh g−1 at 2−4 mg cm−2 and 240 mAh g−1 at >10 mg
cm−2 active-material mass loadings (Figure 5C). In fact,
although TAQ has a nominal voltage lower than that of
common inorganic cathodes, electrode-level gravimetric
specific energies for TAQ cathodes over a range of C rates
outperform even optimized inorganic cathodes (Figures 5D,
S32, S33). For instance, TAQ cathodes deliver at least 20−
30% higher energy density, at the electrode level, than most of
the composite cathodes based on single-crystalline NMC811
(NMC811-sc), commercial polycrystalline NMC811 and
NMC111, or even state-of-the-art Co-free oxides, at rates
from ∼0.1 C to 10 C.47−54 Notably, TAQ also delivers higher
gravimetric energy density than graphite-coated LiFePO4
(LFP-GC) cathodes at charging rates that are at least 10
times faster.48 Equally importantly, TAQ electrodes deliver a
higher volumetric energy density than comparable LFP
electrodes (Table S7). TAQ thus presents measurable
advantages relative to the leading contemporary LIB cathode
