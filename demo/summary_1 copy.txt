The study aimed to find existing drugs that could be repurposed to treat COVID-19. They used a large library of around 12,000 approved or clinically tested drugs, thus have known pharmacological and human safety profiles, which enable them quickly used in preclinical and clinical evaluation. 
In total, 100 drugs were discovered to be able to stop the virus from replicating in cells. Cellular half maximal effective concentration (EC50) is a good indication for therapeutic dose ranges and 13 drugs exhibited an EC50 value less than 500 nM, indicating they were effective at doses likely safe for patients. ONO 5334, MDL 28170 and apilimod showed antiviral activity in human induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived pneumocyte-like cells by reducing the number of infected cells by 72%, 65% and 85%, respectively. Apilimod was also effective in an ex vivo lung culture system by reducing viral titre with plaque assay.
Time-of-addition experiments identify which stage of the viral life cycle compounds target. The five most potent compounds—apilimod, VBY-825, ONO 5334, Z LVG CHN2, and MDL 28170—inhibit viral entry. The protease inhibitors VBY-825, ONO 5334, Z LVG CHN2, and MDL 28170 do not inhibit SARS-CoV-2's 3C-like or papain-like proteases, suggesting they act on host proteases. Z LVG CHN2 likely targets endosomal proteases, while MDL 28170, ONO 5334, and VBY-825 inhibit various cathepsins necessary for viral protein processing.
